# Original Portfolio


## Purpose

Create a deployed portfolio of my work samples so that employers can assess if i am a good canaidate for their position.

## Description

I used html and css to create a webpage to show a portfolio of my work. I incorperated flexbox and media queries to adjust the page for screen size. I also used links in all of the projects and links in the header to the appropriate sections. I also used hover to change the border color when the mouse is hovering over it.
